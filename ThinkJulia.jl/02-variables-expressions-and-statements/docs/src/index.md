# Chapter 2 Exercises

Solutions to Chapter 2 Exercises should be implemented in `src/Exercises.jl`
of this folder. The `src/main.jl` script can be used to run each of these
in sequence.

## Exercise 2-1:

To check your understanding, type the following statements in the Julia REPL
and see what they do:

```julia
5
x = 5
x + 1
```

Now put the same statements in a script and run it. What is the output?
Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement
and then run it again.

## Exercise 2-3:

Practice using the Julia REPL as a calculator.

### Exercise 2-3-1:

The volume of a sphere with radius ``r`` is ``\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}``.
What is the volume of a sphere with radius ``r``?

```@docs

```

### Exercise 2-3-2:

Suppose the cover price of a book is \\\$24.95, but bookstores get a
40% discount. Shipping costs \\\$3 for the first copy and 75 cents

### Exercise 2-3-3:

(8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at a tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1
mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
